**Instructions for Running the Frontend (Chatbot UI)**

To run the chatbot UI and test the backend API integration for file uploads, follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:** Open your terminal and change your current directory to the frontend project folder. Based on the project structure we've been working with, this should be:
    ```bash
    cd Chatbot_React_Update/cleantech-chatbot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:** If this is the first time setting up the frontend, you need to install the project dependencies. Run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:** Once the dependencies are installed, start the React development server using webpack:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This command will compile the frontend code and typically open the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Backend Work Needed for File and Image Uploads Summary**

As discussed previously, the backend needs to implement an API endpoint to handle file uploads initiated by the frontend. Here's a summary of the key tasks for the backend:

1.  **Create a POST endpoint:** Design and implement a `POST` API endpoint (e.g., `/api/upload`) that the frontend can send file data to.
2.  **Receive and Process File Data:** Configure the endpoint to accept incoming file data sent via `FormData` from the frontend.
3.  **Store the File:** Implement logic to save the uploaded file to a storage location (local server directory or cloud storage like AWS S3).
4.  **Generate and Return URL:** After successful storage, generate a public URL for the saved file and return this URL in the API response to the frontend. The frontend will use this URL to display the uploaded image or file link in the chat.
5.  **Handle Errors:** Implement robust error handling for scenarios like upload failures, invalid file types, or storage issues, and return appropriate error responses.

Once the backend has this upload endpoint ready, I can update the frontend code in `Chatbot.tsx` to send the selected files to this endpoint and use the returned URL to display them in the chat messages.
