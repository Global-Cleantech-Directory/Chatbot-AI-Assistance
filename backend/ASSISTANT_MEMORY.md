# Assistant Memory Backend System

## üß† Overview

The Assistant Memory Backend is an intelligent conversation memory system that stores and analyzes every user interaction with the chatbot, enabling highly personalized follow-up communications.

## ‚úÖ System Status: **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

All components have been implemented, tested, and integrated successfully.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ConversationMemory Model** (`models/ConversationMemory.js`)
   - Stores structured conversation context
   - Tracks user profile, interests, and engagement
   - Analyzes conversation patterns and outcomes

2. **AssistantMemoryService** (`lib/assistantMemory.js`)
   - Analyzes messages for intent, sentiment, and topics
   - Updates conversation memory in real-time
   - Generates personalized email context

3. **Enhanced Email Service** (`lib/emailService.js`)
   - Integrates conversation memory for personalization
   - Creates dynamic email content based on user context
   - Adapts tone and recommendations per conversation

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Message Analysis
Every user message is automatically analyzed for:
- **Sentiment**: Positive, neutral, negative
- **Business Sectors**: Renewable energy, water treatment, etc.
- **Business Needs**: Suppliers, partnerships, funding, etc.
- **User Role**: CEO, CTO, Procurement Manager, etc.
- **Urgency Level**: High, medium, low
- **Pain Points**: Cost, complexity, time, reliability, etc.

### 2. Memory Storage
The system stores:
```javascript
{
  sessionId: "unique-session-id",
  context: {
    interests: {
      sectors: ["renewable energy", "water treatment"],
      technologies: ["solar panels", "filtration"],
      businessNeeds: ["suppliers", "partnerships"],
      timeline: "urgent"
    },
    userProfile: {
      role: "CEO",
      industry: "manufacturing",
      communicationStyle: "professional"
    },
    engagement: {
      messageCount: 5,
      engagementLevel: "high",
      lastActiveAt: "2025-01-21T11:30:00Z"
    }
  },
  analysis: {
    urgencyLevel: "high",
    decisionMaker: true,
    painPoints: ["cost", "reliability"]
  }
}
```

### 3. Email Personalization
Follow-up emails are automatically personalized with:
- **Personalized greeting** based on user role
- **Relevant content** focused on their interests
- **Adapted tone** matching their communication style
- **Specific recommendations** based on conversation context
- **Urgency awareness** respecting their timeline

## üîå API Integration

### Chat Endpoint Enhanced
```javascript
POST /api/chat
// Now automatically:
// 1. Analyzes user message
// 2. Updates conversation memory
// 3. Stores context for future emails
```

### New Memory Endpoints
```javascript
GET /api/memory/:sessionId
// Returns full conversation memory

GET /api/email-preview/:sessionId/:emailType
// Generates personalized email preview
```

### Email System Enhanced
```javascript
POST /api/email-signup
// Now uses conversation memory to:
// 1. Schedule personalized follow-ups
// 2. Adapt content to user context
// 3. Set appropriate communication tone
```
